# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! I can think of a couple things I would need
help on:

1. It would be great to include an inductance calculator.
2. Better documenation is always appreciated.  If there's something you needed
to figure out when trying to use this tool, you're probably not the only one!
Please write something up and submit it as a PR!  At the very least, report it
as an issue so I can try to address it.
3. Writing other versions of this tool for other apertures, such as rectilinear,
oval, etc. 
4. It would be great to see other configurations, including different uses of
layers and/or vias.
